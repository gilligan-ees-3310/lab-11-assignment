T1. Start by reading [`lab-11-instructions.pdf`](lab-11-instructions.pdf),
   which describes things you need to know for this lab.
   You can also read the online version,
   [`lab-11-instructions.md`](lab-11-instructions.md)

2. When you come to lab, you choose a country to study and start investigating
   its energy use, its greenhouse gas emissions, and the commitments it made
   for the Paris Agreement to cut its emissions. 
   
## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github to your
  own computer.
* Investigate emissions reduction policies in the country of your choice.
* Write a report. **You do not need to use RMarkdown for this assignment.**
  You can choose whether to use 
  RMarkdown or a conventional word processor, such as Microsoft Word to 
  write your report. 
* Whatever format you choose, generate a PDF file from your report 
  (if you use Word, there is an option in the "File" menu to save the 
  document as a PDF file.), and commit and push the PDF file to GitHub.

  If you run into difficulty and need extra time, please contact Mr. de Wet or 
  Prof. Gilligan.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.
