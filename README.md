There are two files for this lab.

1. Start by reading [`lab-10-instructions.pdf`](lab-10-instructions.pdf),
   which describes things you need to know for this lab.
   You can also read the online version,
   [`lab-10-instructions.md`](lab-10-instructions.md)

   This file also has the exercises you will do for this lab.

2. When you come to lab, you will work through the exercises, and you will
   edit the file `lab-10-report.Rmd` to write your answers and show your
   work.

## Instructions:

* Accept this assignment.
* Clone a local copy of the file repository from github to your
  own computer.
* In your local repository, answer the exercises in the template
  `lab-10-data_exercises.Rmd`.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` files into PDF files.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to the `.Rmd` files
  and the new PDF files) to your local git repository.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to github.

  If you run into difficulty and need extra time, please contact Mr. de Wet or 
  Prof. Gilligan.

I advise using git to commit changes frequently as you work and push those 
commits to GitHub.

I also advise knitting your answers frequently to make sure that they 
knit correctly.
